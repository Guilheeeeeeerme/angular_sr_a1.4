# Creed: Angular Code Challenge #

`Due Date:` End of the Day (5:00 PM) five days from the date you receive this test.

We recommend setting up the project in a hosted GIT repository to code share, or you can send it back in a .zip file.

`*Note:` If you have any questions or get stuck don’t hesitate to reach out.

The purpose of this test is to evaluate your experience with modern code languages and web/app development preferred stacks to get a better understanding on how you work with projects and tasks.

We will be evaluating your experience with HTML, Typescript, and CSS/SCSS within the Angular framework. The guidelines for what we're looking to scrutinize can be found in the README.md “Contribution guidelines” section.
